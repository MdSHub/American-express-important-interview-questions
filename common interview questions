Student: What is bivariate data?

Mentor: Bivariate data is data that involves two different variables whose values can change. 
Bivariate data deals with relationships between these two variables.
The purpose of bivariate data is to analyze and explain this relationship.

Student: Is all data bivariate?

Mentor: Actually, some data has only one variable.
For example, if I were to record the ages of all students in a school and graph my data, 
then there would only be one variable, the age of the students.
This type of data is known as univariate data and it does not deal with relationships, but rather it is used to describe something. 
In this example univariate data is used to express the ages of the students in a school.


What is normal distribution?

Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, 
showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.

Can mean and variance can be the same? When will they be different?
for poison distribution mean and variance be same..


MULTITHTREADING ,MULTITASKING AND MULTIPROGRAMMMING
Multiprogramming is the ability for more than one user to use the computer at a time using a single CPU. 
The idea is to effectively utilize the processor to create multiple ready-to-run processes with each process belongs to 
different user.
Multitasking means concurrent execution of multiple processes by one user on the same computer utilizing multiplenCPUs.



Diffrence between hashtable and hashmap?
Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not. This makes HashMap better for non-threaded applications,
as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones.

Hashtable does not allow null keys or values. HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values.



What is a Hash Function?

A function that converts a given big phone number to a small practical integer value.
The mapped integer value is used as an index in the hash table.
In simple terms, a hash function maps a big number or string to a small integer that can be used as the index in the hash table.

The mod method:
In this method for creating hash functions,
we map a key into one of the slots of table by taking the remainder of key divided by table_size.
That is, the hash function is
h(key) = key mod table_size 

i.e. key % table_size



The multiplication method:
In multiplication method, we multiply the key k by a constant real number c in the range 0 < c < 1 and 
extract the fractional part of k * c.
Then we multiply this value by table_size m and take the floor of the result. It can be represented as
h(k) = floor (m * (k * c mod 1))
                     or
h(k) = floor (m * frac (k * c))

OSI MODEL?
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is a reference model for how applications communicate over a network.
IT professionals use OSI to model or trace how data is sent or received over a network.
This model breaks down data transmission over a series of seven layers, 
each of which is responsible for performing specific tasks concerning sending and receiving data.
The seven layers of function are provided by a combination of applications, operating systems, network card device drivers 
and networking hardware that 
enable a system to transmit a signal over a network Ethernet or fiber optic cable or through Wi-Fi or other wireless protocols.

1.PHYSICAL LAYER;;  bit synchronization,bit rate control,transmission mode,actual transfer of bits.* Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cables are Physical Layer devices.
2.DATA LINK LAYER:  :node to node delivery of the message., it is the responsibility of DLL to transmit it to the Host using its MAC address.
                     framing,error control,flow control,hysical addressing,access control.* Data Link layer is handled by the NIC (Network Interface Card) 
                     and device drivers of host machines.*** Switch & Bridge are Data Link Layer devices.
 3.NETWORK LAYER:: transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks.Routing and logical addressing
 4.TRANSPORT LAYER:: data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments. 
                    It is responsible for the End to End delivery of the complete message
                    performed by OS,connectionless or connection oriented,port number.
                    
 5.SESSION LAYER::   Session establishment, maintenance,authentication and termination,SYNCHROMIZATION.
 6.PRESENTATION LAYER:: Translation,encryption/decryption,compression.
 7.APPLICATION LAYER:: Browser,skype,etc..
 
 OSI model acts as a reference model and is not implemented in Internet because of its late invention. 
 Current model being used is the TCP/IP model.
 
ques : Explain different types of RAID in DBMS?
redundancy array of the independent disk.
It is a technology which is used to connect multiple secondary storage devices for increased performance, data redundancy or both.
It gives you the ability to survive one or more drive failure depending upon the RAID level used.

RAID
RAID refers to redundancy array of the independent disk. It is a technology which is used to connect multiple secondary storage devices for increased performance, data redundancy or both. It gives you the ability to survive one or more drive failure depending upon the RAID level used.

It consists of an array of disks in which multiple disks are connected to achieve different goals.

RAID technology
There are 7 levels of RAID schemes. These schemas are as RAID 0, RAID 1, ...., RAID 6.


These levels contain the following characteristics:

It contains a set of physical disk drives.
In this technology, the operating system views these separate disks as a single logical disk.
In this technology, data is distributed across the physical drives of the array.
Redundancy disk capacity is used to store parity information.
In case of disk failure, the parity information can be helped to recover the data.
 
 RAID 0 :: data can place inside multple disk,no fault tolerance,once data is lost not recovered.high performance and throughput
 RAID 1 :: copies data from one drive to another,expense is high
 RAID 2 ::  bit-level striping using hamming code parity,
             each data bit in a word is recorded on a separate disk and ECC code of data words is stored on different set disks
             Due to its high cost and complex structure, this level is not commercially used. 
             This same performance can be achieved by RAID 3 at a lower cost.
 RAID 3 ::   RAID 3 consists of byte-level striping with dedicated parity.In case of drive failure, the parity drive is accessed,
             and data is reconstructed from the remaining devices.
             Once the failed drive is replaced, the missing data can be restored on the new drive.
             High speed data transmission.slow performance,data is accessed in parallel.require atleast 3 disk.
RAID 4 ::    block-level stripping with a parity disk. Instead of duplicating data, the RAID 4 adopts a parity-based approach.
             require at least 3 disk,,recover 1 disk only at a time..
RAID 5 ::  block-level striping with DISTRIBUTED parity.same as raid 4.
RAID 6 ::   block-level stripping with 2 parity bits.survive 2 concurrent disk failures,
             This level performs RAID 0 to strip data and RAID 1 to mirror. In this level, stripping is performed before mirroring.
            In this level, drives required should be multiple of 2.
            It is not utilized 100% disk capability as half is used for mirroring.
            It contains very limited scalability.
            
            
question :: difference between Zero and NULL Character?  
       NULL is used for pointers only as it is defined as (void *) 0. It should not be used other than pointers. 
       If NULL is assigned to a pointer, then pointer is pointing to nothing.
       0 (zero) is a value.
    
 Explain Different types of Machine Learning with example.
 SUPERVISED :regresion and classification.
 UNSUPERVISED :clustering(group similar data together).
REINFORCEMENT:

REALLIFE EXAMPLE OF OOPS COMCEPTS
ENCAPSULATION:  presence of data and functions manipulating data together.
Encapsulation is a method for protecting data from unwanted access or alteration by packaging it in an object
where it is only accessible through the object's interface. 
Encapsulation are often referred to as information hiding. 
INHERITANCE:
ABSTRACTION:hiding our irrelevanced data;for ex to use a loptop we dont need to know how internal hardwware works.
POLYMORPHISM:Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.


encapsulation example:
When you log into your email accounts such as Gmail, Yahoo mail, or Rediff mail, there is a lot of internal processes taking place in the backend and you have no control over it. 
When you enter the password for logging, they are retrieved in an encrypted form and verified and then you are given the access to your account. 
You do not have control over it that how the password has been verified. Thus, it keeps our account safe from being misused.

What Are the Different Authentication Factors?
Whether a user is accessing his email or the corporate payroll files, he needs to verify his identity before that access is granted. There are three possible ways this user can prove he is who he claims to be:

Knowledge—the user provides information only he knows, like a password or answers to challenge questions
Possession—the user supplies an item he has, like a YubiKey or a one-time password
Inherence—the user relies on a characteristic unique to who he is, such as a fingerprint, retina scan, or voice recognition
The difference between MFA and 2FA is simple. 
Two-factor authentication always utilizes two of these factors to verify the user’s identity.
Multi-factor authentication could involve two of the factors or it could involve all three.
“Multi-factor” just means any number of factors greater than one.

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. 
Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.
By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.


Continuous Integration brings multiple benefits to your organization:

Say goodbye to long and tense integrations
Increase visibility enabling greater communication
Catch issues early and nip them in the bud
Spend less time debugging and more time adding features
Build a solid foundation
Stop waiting to find out if your code’s going to work
Reduce integration problems allowing you to deliver software more rapidly
